### Webp upload error

"I have a problem with uploading webp images to woocommerce. I get the error: Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons."

Change the following values to your own.

File `/plugins/woocommerce/includes/wc-rest-functions.php`

Add the following code `'webp' => 'image/webp',` to the function `wc_get_endpoint_url`:

```php
/**
 * Returns image mime types users are allowed to upload via the API.
 *
 * @since  2.6.4
 * @return array
 */
function wc_rest_allowed_image_mime_types() {
	return apply_filters(
		'woocommerce_rest_allowed_image_mime_types',
		array(
			'jpg|jpeg|jpe' => 'image/jpeg',
			'gif'          => 'image/gif',
			'png'          => 'image/png',
			'bmp'          => 'image/bmp',
			'tiff|tif'     => 'image/tiff',
			'ico'          => 'image/x-icon',
            'webp'         => 'image/webp',
		)
	);
}
```
