### Query Parameters

<ParamField query="where[or][0][and][0][name][equals]" type="string" optional={true} placeholder="stockx-us">
    An example of a query parameter for the name field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="where[or][0][and][0][sku][equals]" type="string" optional={true} placeholder="CD4487-100">
    An example of a query parameter for the sku field.
</ParamField>

<Note>I want to get all products with a retail price of 85 or 90 and with a description.</Note>

```markdown Example Query
GET https://app.retailed.io/api/v1/products?where[or][0][and][0][price][in]=85&where[or][1][and][0][price][in]=90&where[or][2][and][0][description][exists]=true&sort=-description
```

### Sort

Retailed find queries support a sort parameter through all APIs. Pass the name of a top-level field to sort by that field in ascending order.
Prefix the name of the field with a minus symbol ("-") to sort in descending order.
Because sorting is handled by the database, the field you wish to sort on must be stored in the database to work; not a virtual field.

`https://app.retailed.io/api/v1/products?sort=-createdAt`
