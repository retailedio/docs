### Query Parameters

<ParamField query="where[or][0][and][0][id][equals]" type="string" optional={true} placeholder="5702016914306">
    An example of a query parameter for the id (upc or ean) field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="where[or][0][and][0][category][equals]" type="string" optional={true} placeholder="collectibles">
    An example of a query parameter for the category field : `sneakers`, `collectibles`, etc.
</ParamField>

### Sort

Retailed find queries support a sort parameter through all APIs. Pass the name of a top-level field to sort by that field in ascending order.
Prefix the name of the field with a minus symbol ("-") to sort in descending order.
Because sorting is handled by the database, the field you wish to sort on must be stored in the database to work; not a virtual field.
