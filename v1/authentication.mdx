## How to Create an Account

Navigate to the [Retailed Dashboard](https://app.retailed.io/login) and simply follow the steps to log in or create a new account.

## Retrieving a Token

After you've logged in to the dashboard, follow these steps to get a token:

1.  Click **API Keys**.
2.  Select **New**.
3.  Assign a name for the token. This helps in future referencing. You can also add notes to describe its use-case, then select **Save**.

A new token will be displayed in text format with a **copy to clipboard** button. Use this button to copy the token and secure it in a safe place.

<Tip>
    Remember that you can view the logs and track the number of requests made on the dashboard.

## Testing the Token

Once you have your token, you can test it using the Terminal. Set up the environment by entering and executing the following command. Replace `<TOKEN>` with the token you've copied from the Retailed dashboard:

```bash
export RETAILED_TOKEN="<TOKEN>"
```

This step eliminates the need to copy and paste the token each time it's in use. You are now ready to make a call to the Retailed Usage service. Use the following command to proceed:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $RETAILED_TOKEN" https://app.retailed.io/api/usage | jq .
```

The response should look like this:

```json
{
    "plan": "API",
    "remaining": "14823"
}
```

This command will return the number of remaining requests under your token.

<Note>
    Keep in mind that most examples in this documentation assume that you have set the `$RETAILED_TOKEN` variable.
</Note>

## Wrapping up

Congratulations! You have successfully authenticated with the Retailed API using a generated token.
