🔍 At Retailed, we take great pride in the quality of our API. To ensure a smooth and uninterrupted user experience, we have established a robust infrastructure of automated unit tests, aided by tools such as Betteruptime and Cypress.

## Betteruptime

🚨 Betteruptime is a monitoring platform that allows us to monitor the availability of our API endpoints in real-time. In case of an incident, we are immediately alerted and can intervene to correct the issue before it affects our users. Thanks to this platform, we are able to ensure high availability of our API.

## Cypress

🌲 Cypress is an automated testing tool that allows us to simulate user interactions with our API. We can verify that each endpoint responds correctly to requests and common scenarios. The tests are executed with each code change, allowing us to quickly detect errors before they are deployed to production.

## Log Monitoring

📊 In addition to our automated testing infrastructure, we also closely monitor our logs through a custom dashboard and Google Cloud Platform's log dashboard. This allows us to identify issues and quickly troubleshoot any problems that may arise.

## Automated Unit Testing

✅ Automated unit testing has numerous benefits for our API, including:

- Ensuring high-quality code
- Reducing the likelihood of errors or bugs
- Saving time and money by catching issues early in the development process
- Boosting confidence in the code base

We are committed to using the latest technologies and tools to deliver the best possible user experience. Our investment in automated unit testing is just one example of our dedication to quality and excellence.
